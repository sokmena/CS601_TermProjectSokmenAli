            <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website! I am an economist and software developer based in Istanbul, Turkey. I am 35, married and have a cute baby daughter. 
                So far, I have lived in three other countries: USA, United Kingdom and Germany. I speak fluent English and German, in addition to my native Turkish.</p>
            <p>I currently work as an economist in development banking, and am doing a master's degree on software development. You can learn more about my professional background <a href=./cv.html>here</a>. My interests include archery, playing guitar and playing online computer games. You can find more information on these in the <a href=./interests.html>interests page</a>.</p>
            <p>This website contains mainly personal and career information about me. However, I hope to include some of the more interesting development projects as I expand my portfolio. Happy browsing!</p>
